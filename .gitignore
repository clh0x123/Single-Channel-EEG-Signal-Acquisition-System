# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it's generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially important for binary packages to ensure reproducibility,
#   but may not be necessary for projects with simple dependencies.
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock and poetry.lock,
#   it's recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml,
#   but it is recommended to not include it in version control.
